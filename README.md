# CFST_Strength_Prediction
Comparative study of data driven models for strength prediction of CFST columns using Machine Learning approach

Different data driven models using ML algorithms such as BR-Artificial neural network, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression were developed and compared to find the best model in predicting ultimate axial capacity of CFST ( Concrete filled steel tube ) columns from a compiled dataset. Also, correlation analysis was done to determine the influence of different input parameters and the most important parameter was found out that determine the strength of the column. An empirical equation was also developed from the best fit model to predict the strength of the column.
